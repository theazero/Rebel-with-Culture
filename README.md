# Rebel with Culture: Museum Event Concept

This project is a concept for a one-night event at the **Nordiska Museet** aimed at engaging 20-30-year-olds, who are typically unfamiliar with museums. The event transforms the museum into a playful, rebellious space, allowing young adults to take over the venue and interact with its historical exhibits in a contemporary context.

> **Note**: The project is in Swedish.

### Event Highlights:

- **Interactive Fashion Show**: Featuring designs from Beckmans students, with models mingling among guests.
- **Historical Culinary Experience**: A modern take on historical dining, inspired by the museum’s “Dukade Bord” exhibition.
- **Dance Show**: A performance by Balettakademien, blending music and dance through the ages.
- **Music & Mingling**: The main hall serves as the event’s hub for mingling, drinks, and music.

The goal is to offer a fresh, immersive museum experience, blending history with modern culture to attract a new generation of visitors.
